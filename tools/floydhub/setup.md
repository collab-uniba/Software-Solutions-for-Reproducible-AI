After installing `requirements.txt`, follow the instructions [on this page of the FloydHub docs](https://docs.floydhub.com/guides/basics/login/) to login using Floyd CLI.

In the script `setup.sh` I've collected the instructions that I followed to initialize the FloydHub project locally.

In `run.sh` I've pasted the `run` commands that I tried out following the official FloydHub quick-start tutorial.

*N.B.*: As usual, before running the `.sh` scripts, remember to write and source a `.env` file with your user account and project details based on the `.env-template` example.
